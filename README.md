# General-Purpose-ECU
This General Purpose ECU was developed as the core project of my Bachelor's thesis. The objective was to design an ECU versatile enough to function as a **Zone Controller**, 
an **Intra-Zone ECU**, or a **Peripheral Device**. This development establishes a foundational component for test setups dedicated to researching future automotive architectures.

## Concept
In order to implement this versatility, several bus interfaces were implemented on the board.
